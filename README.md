# Introduction

The following repository represents an implementation of binary and multi-class classifiers based on SVM using LIBSVM & Scikit-learn packages. This study is accompanied with extensive experimentation of variation of hyperparameters (kernel function, degree, C & Î³).

# Packages Used

The following packages have been used while training of the model and visualization puposes :
- numpy : for linear algebra operations
- pandas : for data processing operations I/O in CSV file
- scikit-learn : to implement machine learning methods
- matplotlib : for data visualization and graphical plotting
- math : access to some common math functions and constants
- libsvm : Machine Learning package for SVMs (see details [here](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/))

# Result for Part 2 (based on Part 1)
An accuracy of 96.8% on test set of 2K image data (10-class classifier) has been achieved for the model trained on 8K image data.
